###### Bio


Olivier Sigaud received a Phd in Computer Science from Paris XI University (Orsay) in 1996, PhD from Paris I University in 2004.  Initially working in as a research engineer in the industry (Dassault Aviation from 1995 to 2001), he pursues a career of researcher in the university in the fields of reinforcement learning and learning for robotics.  He is now Professor at the Institut for Intelligent Systems and Robotics (ISIR) at Sorbonne University, Paris. 


<br>

His research is focused on designing and exploiting machine learning techniques dedicated to growing motor and cognitive capabilities in robots. In practice, his work lies between machine learning, developmental robotics and computational neurosciences.

<br>

He was responsible of a group about Learning for Control and Decision in Robotics (team of four permanent researchers) at ISIR, and has been in charge of the activities about learning in the Robotics and Neuroscience group of the french working group in Robotics until 2014. He has been the principal investigator of the MACSi project (up to april 2014) based on our iCub humanoid robot. Since then, he participated to many european project, including CODYCO and DREAM, and is currenlty taking part to the PILLAR project.
