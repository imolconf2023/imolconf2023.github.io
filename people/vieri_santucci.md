###### Bio

Vieri Giuliano Santucci is a researcher at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (CNR, Rome). He holds a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Plymouth (UK), an M.S. degree in theories and techniques of knowledge, faculty of Philosophy (University of Rome “La Sapienza”) and a B.Sc. degree in Philosophy (University of Pisa). His interests range from autonomous learning processes to motivations in both biological and artificial agents. His actual work focusses on the development of robotic architectures that allow artificial agents to autonomously improve their competences on the basis of the biologically-inspired construct of intrinsic motivations. He published in peer-reviewed journals and attended many international conferences, and actively contributed to the European Projects 'IM-CLeVeR - Intrinsically-Motivated Cumulative-Learning Versatile Robots' and 'GOAL - Robots'.
